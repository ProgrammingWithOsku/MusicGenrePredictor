# Music Genre Prediction Project

## Overview

This project, developed by Osamah Amer, utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to predict music genres based on user features such as age and gender. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for the machine learning model, and Matplotlib for visualization. The analysis and modeling process are demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook.
